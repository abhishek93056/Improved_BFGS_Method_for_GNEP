# Improved_BFGS_Method_for_GNEP
Matlab (R2022a) codes for BFGS method




In Selection of Method Armizo or Goldstein method,

	%method0=armizo
   method0=WWP

1--Silent "method0=armizo" to use MWWP line search technique 
2--  Silent  "method0=WWP" to use Armijo-Goldstein line search technique.



In the section    " Initial values" (Top -10 lines) for Matlab codes of problem 1, problem-2, problem-3, problem-5 
  (in problem-4, we have given initial values after the objective function)


We need to give random initial values with specific norms.
